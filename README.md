# magic-8-ball
Magic 8 ball, a nice little toy to replicate fortune telling. Typically made out of plastic and having a dice with possible answers inside of it, it has become a poular children's toy of fate and fortune. Then theres also the easy cheap version of flipping a rubber with the answers "yes" or "no" on each side of them. 
# orpheus's version
I decided i was going to replicate this little game as a coded project using Python AppJar, and i originally decided it was going to be themed around a frog instead of an eight ball. Obviously, as you can see, this repo isn't labeled "frog-magic-8-ball-" and i halfway changed everything to a theme of the cute hack club mascot Orpheus.
# Making It
This project was pretty fun to make, drawing out a sleepy eepy orpheus snoozing and a more fortune-teller version, boba orpheus on Procreate. Also of course actually coding it turned out to be pretty simple, appJar GUIs that i'm now pretty familiar with, and using a Random Module (something i haven't really used before) to make orpheus use a variety of possible answers. Pretty fun overall.
